# llm-benchpacks

Portable benchmark packs for local LLM runtimes and coding-agent workloads.

This repository is for answering practical questions such as:

- Is direct `mlx-lm` faster than Ollama's MLX path on the same Mac?
- How does `llama-server` compare to `mlx_lm.server` on the same prompt shape?
- Which model/runtime combination is usable for a real coding-agent workflow?
- Do small hosted GPUs, such as Hetzner's RTX 4000 SFF Ada machines, behave differently enough that we need separate recommendations?

The project should measure both raw inference behavior and workload behavior. Raw
tokens/sec is useful, but coding agents also depend on time to first token,
prefill speed, prompt-cache reuse, long-context stability, tool-call formatting,
and whether the final repository changes pass verification.

## Documentation

- [Specification](docs/specification.md): product scope, benchmark model, metrics, and MVP.
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): proposed runner, adapters, packs, and result schema.
- [Implementation Plan](docs/implementation-plan.md): phased path from minimal runner to remote GPU comparisons.
- [Benchpack Format](docs/benchpack-format.md): initial manifest sketch.
- [Hardware Targets](docs/hardware-targets.md): initial machines and runtime assumptions.
- [Decisions](docs/decisions.md): durable design decisions.
- [Spec Log](docs/spec-log.md): dated changes to the spec and open design questions.
- [Run Log](docs/run-log.md): benchmark run history and result pointers.

## Initial Shape

The first implementation should stay small:

1. A CLI that can run one benchmark pack against one endpoint.
2. An OpenAI-compatible adapter for `mlx_lm.server`, `llama-server`, vLLM, LM Studio, and similar servers.
3. An Ollama-native adapter for `/api/generate` so we retain Ollama's native timing fields.
4. A smoke benchmark and one real workload pack from `desktop-django-starter`.
5. JSONL result artifacts plus a small Markdown summary.

The repository is private while the spec and first runner are still unstable.
