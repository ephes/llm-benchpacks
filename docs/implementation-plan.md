# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Minimal Runner

**Status:** landed 2026-04-26. See `docs/spec-log.md` for the dated entries.

Deliver a CLI that can run one benchmark case against one endpoint and write
results.

Scope:

- Python package managed with `uv`.
- `benchpack run <pack> --adapter <adapter> --model <model>` (with
  `--endpoint`, `--out`, `--host-label`, `--force`).
- `openai-chat` adapter.
- `ollama-generate` adapter.
- `smoke-chat` benchmark pack.
- JSONL run output plus Markdown summary, with `endpoint` recorded per run.
- Best-effort hardware metadata on macOS and Linux.
- Refuse-to-overwrite collision rule on the per-run output directory.

Validation:

- `uv run pytest` (manifest loading, result normalization, scoring,
  re-run safety, adapter HTTP handling).
- Smoke run against a locally reachable endpoint.

## Phase 2: Runtime Sweep

Add fixed-context performance cases that make runtime comparisons meaningful.

**Status:** in progress. Streaming TTFT measurement for OpenAI-compatible
endpoints landed 2026-04-26, pack-driven warmup/repetitions landed 2026-04-26,
and the bundled `runtime-sweep` pack landed 2026-04-27; see
`docs/spec-log.md`.

Scope:

- `runtime-sweep` pack with short, medium, and long prompt cases. **Landed
  2026-04-27.**
- Streaming TTFT measurement for OpenAI-compatible endpoints. **Landed
  2026-04-26.**
- Ollama native timing extraction.
- Warmup and repetitions. **Landed 2026-04-26.**
- Compare command that reads multiple result directories. **Remaining.**

Validation:

- Same pack can run against `mlx_lm.server`, `llama-server`, and Ollama.

## Phase 3: Desktop Django Workload

Add the first real coding-agent-shaped workload.

Scope:

- Import or generate the `desktop-django-starter` resolved wrap prompt.
- Include a compact target-repo snapshot fixture.
- Add deterministic constraints for short output comparison.
- Add optional full agent-session replay later.

Validation:

- The pack runs on Apple Silicon and Linux without path-specific edits.

## Phase 4: Task Completion Benchmarks

Move beyond speed into correctness.

Scope:

- `patch-from-failure` pack.
- Disposable worktree setup.
- Model output to patch extraction or agent-harness integration.
- Deterministic scoring by tests passing, diff size, and timeout.

Validation:

- A baseline model/runtime pair can solve at least one toy fixture end to end.

## Phase 5: Remote Host Orchestration

Make remote GPU runs practical.

Scope:

- Document a manual remote workflow first.
- Optional SSH runner after local execution is stable.
- Artifact pullback from hosts such as `hetzner-gex44`.
- Host labels and result comparison across machines.

Validation:

- A run from a remote Linux CUDA host can be compared with a local Mac run.
